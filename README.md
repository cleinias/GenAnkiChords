GenAnkiChords create a new Anki deck of cards for commonly used jazz chords 
and voicings.

The data about the voicings are mostly drawn from Phil DeGreg's 
_Jazz Keyboard Harmony_ (New Albany, Ind., Jamey Aebersold Jazz, 1992). 

For each chord, GenAnkiChords generates one Anki note including, note names, 
musical score representation, piano sound, and piano fingerings 
(as separate media files linked to the notes). From each note, it generates multiple 
cards for  each note's voicings.

By default,  the notes cover 7th chords in Maj7, min7, dom 7, and half-dim qualities 
in all keys (chords coverage can easily be reduced or increased by changing a pair
of parameters in GenAnkiChords's  homonymous main class).
